# Project 17. Swifty Ninja

## Concepts

- `SKShapeNode`
- `AVAudioPlayer`
- `SKAction` groups
- `UIBezierPath`
- `CGVector`

## Notes

The default gravity of the `physicsWorld` in SpriteKit is **-0.98** by default.

A `SKShapeNode` lets you define any kind of shape you can draw, along with line width, stroke color and more, and it will render it to the screen.
