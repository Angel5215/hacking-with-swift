# Project 7. Whitehouse petitions.

## Concepts

* `UITabBarController`
* `JSON` (Javascript Object Notation)
* `guard`
* `AppDelegate.swift`


## Notes

A **navigation controller** lets us contorl which screen is currently visible. A **tab bar** (seen in apps such as App Store, Music, Photos) lets the user control which screen they want to view vy tapping on what interests them.

Behind the scenes, `UITabBarController` manages an array of view controllers that the user can choose between.

`guard` is used to create an *early return*. You set up your code to exit immediately if critical data is missing.
