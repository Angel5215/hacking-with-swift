# Project 16. JavaScript Injection

## Concepts

- Safari extension.
- `NSExtensionItem`
- 

## Notes

A Safari extension lets us embed a version of our app directly inside Safari's action menu to manipulate Safari data in interesting ways.

Safari extensions are launched from within the Safari action menu, but are shipped inside a parent app.

## Extension

When the extension is created, the `extensionContext` let us control how the extension interacts with its parent app.
