## Notes

An iOS app is a directory containing lots of files: the binary, the media assets, visual layout files, and a variety of other things. These app directories are called **Bundles**.

A **View controller** is a screen of information.

The `viewDidLoad()` method is called when the screen has loaded and is ready for us to customize.

The `let` keyword is used to declare **constants**. The `var` keyword is used to create variables.

If you try to use a constant or variable that has a `nil` value, the app will crash.

UIKit is the iOS user interface framework. It contains a lot of built-in user interface tools that can be used to build apps.

**Storyboards** contain the user interface of an app and let us visualize some or all of it on a single screen.
